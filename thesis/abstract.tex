Digital representations of real-world surfaces can now be obtained
automatically using various acquisition devices such as $3D$ scanners and $3D$
photography. These new fast and accurate data sources increase $3D$ surface
resolution by several orders of magnitude. Many computer graphics applications
can take benefit of this automatic process, including: CAD (Computer-Aided
Design), physical simulation, virtual reality, medical imaging, architecture,
archaeology, special effects, computer animation and video games.

Unfortunately, this geometry produced by these media comes at the price of a
large, possibility gigantic, amount of data which requires new efficient data
structure and algorithms offering scalability for processing such objects.

Aiming at interactive and quality visualizations, models produced by these media,
which is point clound, are converted in splat basead representations, which are
oriented disc or ellipses. In this dissertation, we present a
simplification algoritm that works directly with splats, suppressing the need of
a subsequent conversion of the simplified point cloud into a splat based represetation.
